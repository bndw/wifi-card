## Language Contribution Guide

We would love for you to contribute to different languages and help make it even better than it is today! As a language contributor, here are some steps we would like you to follow:

1. Add a translation to [`./src/translations.js`](./src/translations.js). Here's an example of the German translation:

   ```
   {
      id: 'de-DE',              // locale code
      name: 'German - Deutsch', // Display name in the format 'latinName - nativeName'
      rtl: false,               // Optional, true if this is a right-to-left language
      translation: {
         ...
      }
   }
   ```

2. Append an entry to the [Supported Languages](#supported-languages) table below.
