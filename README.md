## Language Contribution Guide

We would love for you to contribute to different languages and help make it even better than it is today! As a language contributor, here are some steps we would like you to follow:

1. Add a translation to [`./src/i18n.js`](./src/i18n.js)
2. Add the language option to [`./src/App.js`](./src/App.js) in the format `latinName - nativeName`, e.g. `French - Fran√ßais`
3. If the languages added require RTL direction, add the language keys to RTL_LANGUAGES constant in ./src/App.js.
4. Add an entry to the translation-table in README.md.
